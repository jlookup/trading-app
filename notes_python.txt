Modules and Paths

The interpreter seeks modules to satisfy import statements by looking in a defined set of Paths
Those paths are stored in sys.path
At runtime, anything stored in the env variable $PYTHONPATH is added to sys.paths.
So if you want to add a path:
    $ export PYTHONPATH='path/to/directory'
    $ export PYTHONPATH=path/to/directory:{$PYTHONPATH}



Getting and setting env variables

import os
os.environ['DEBUSSY'] = '1'
someVariable = int(os.environ['DEBUSSY'])
